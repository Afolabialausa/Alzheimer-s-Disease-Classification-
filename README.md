# AD-classification-Confidence

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for classifying Alzheimer's disease labels from neuroimaging data. The project involves data preprocessing, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, implementing a custom neural network layer for confidence scores, and evaluating model performance using Leave-One-Out cross-validation.

## Folder Structure

### `AD_classification_code`

The `AD_classification_code` folder contains the Python code for computing confidence temperatures ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 in 0.5 steps. Each of the following five Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) corresponds to a specific confidence temperature value:
- `Demntia_Classifcation_&_Confidence_with_Temp_0.5.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 0.5
- `Demntia Classifcation & Confidence with Temp 1.0.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 1.0
- `Demntia Classifcation & Confidence with Temp 1.5.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 1.5
- `Demntia Classifcation & Confidence with Temp 2.0.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 2.0
- `Demntia_Classifcation_&_Confidence_with_Temp_2.5.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 2.5

### `Sample_data`

The `Sample_data` folder contains the dataset used in this project:
- `Data_ADNIMerge_procssedNeuroImaging.csv`: The processed dataset for Alzheimer's disease classification.

### Running the Notebooks in Google Colab

To run a Jupyter notebook from this repository in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Open Google Colab**: Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Open a GitHub Notebook**: Click on the "GitHub" tab.

3. **Authenticate with GitHub (if needed)**: You might need to authenticate your GitHub account to allow access.

4. **Paste the GitHub URL**: Copy and paste the URL of your notebook into the provided field. For example, to open the notebook for confidence temperature 0.5, use: (https://github.com/Afolabialausa/Alzheimer-s-Disease-Classification-/blob/main/AD_classification_code/Demntia_Classifcation_&_Confidence_with_Temp_0.5.ipynb)

5. **Open the Notebook**: Click on the notebook from the search results to open it in Colab.

## Key Features

- **Heterogeneous Data Utilisation**: Incorporation of diverse data sources including cognitive and functional assessments, tau-PET and MRI neuroimaging, medical/family history, demographic data, and APoE genotype for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Confidence Estimation**: A novel approach using a softmax confidence metric based on the networkâ€™s output activity to evaluate classification confidence at the individual level.
- **Custom Neural Network Layer**: Implementation of a custom ConfidenceSoftmax layer that computes confidence scores for each model prediction.
- **Robust Model Evaluation**: Application of Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) to ensure the reliability and robustness of the model's performance.
- **Optimised Confidence Temperature**: Investigation of different confidence softmax temperature values to determine the optimal temperature for the most reliable confidence scores.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing**: Open the Jupyter notebook for the desired confidence temperature (e.g., `Demntia_Classifcation_&_Confidence_with_Temp_0.5.ipynb`) and run the scripts to prepare the data. This includes handling missing data and normalising the dataset.
2. **Training**: Execute the training cells in the same notebook to train the neural network.
3. **Evaluation**: Continue running the notebook to assess model performance. The evaluation includes calculating accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and confidence scores for each class prediction.
4. **Visualisation**: The notebook includes cells to visualise the results and confidence scores.
