# AD-classification-Confidence

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for classifying Alzheimer's disease labels from neuroimaging data. The project involves data preprocessing, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, implementing a custom neural network layer for confidence scores, and evaluating model performance using Leave-One-Out cross-validation.

## Folder Structure

### `AD_classification_code`

The `AD_classification_code` folder contains the Python code for computing confidence temperatures ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 in 0.5 steps. Each of the following five Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) corresponds to a specific confidence temperature value:
- `Demntia_Classifcation_&_Confidence_with_Temp_0.5.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 0.5
- `Demntia Classifcation & Confidence with Temp 1.0.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 1.0
- `Demntia Classifcation & Confidence with Temp 1.5.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 1.5
- `Demntia Classifcation & Confidence with Temp 2.0.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 2.0
- `Demntia_Classifcation_&_Confidence_with_Temp_2.5.ipynb`: Code for confidence temperature 2.5

### Sample Code Overview

The sample code in each notebook initializes necessary libraries, loads data, applies SMOTE, and runs the neural network. Key sections include:

- Importing libraries and setting up the environment.
- Loading and preprocessing the data.
- Applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
- Implementing the neural network and training it.
- Evaluating model performance using various metrics.

## Key Features

- **Heterogeneous Data Utilization**: Incorporation of diverse data sources including cognitive and functional assessments, tau-PET and MRI neuroimaging, medical/family history, demographic data, and APoE genotype for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Confidence Estimation**: A novel approach using a softmax confidence metric based on the networkâ€™s output activity to evaluate classification confidence at the individual level.
- **Custom Neural Network Layer**: Implementation of a custom ConfidenceSoftmax layer that computes confidence scores for each model prediction.
- **Robust Model Evaluation**: Application of Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) to ensure the reliability and robustness of the model's performance.
- **Optimized Confidence Temperature**: Investigation of different confidence softmax temperature values to determine the optimal temperature for the most reliable confidence scores.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing**: Open the Jupyter notebook for the desired confidence temperature (e.g., `Demntia_Classifcation_&_Confidence_with_Temp_0.5.ipynb`) and run the scripts to prepare the data. This includes handling missing data and normalizing the dataset.
2. **Training**: Execute the training cells in the same notebook to train the neural network.
3. **Evaluation**: Continue running the notebook to assess model performance. The evaluation includes calculating accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and confidence scores for each class prediction.
4. **Visualization**: The notebook includes cells to visualize the results and confidence scores.
